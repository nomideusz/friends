# New Internet — Project Manifesto

> *Fresh, clean, people-oriented, network-oriented. Almost Buddhist.*

---

## Core Philosophy

**New Internet** is an innovative project challenging old-school patterns. We propose something new—possibly better—while remaining intuitive for users accustomed to existing patterns.

New Internet is:
- **Friendly** — against violence, welcoming to all
- **People-oriented** — humans first, technology serves them
- **Network-oriented** — connections and communities at the center
- **Minimal** — as simple as possible, but not simpler

---

## Primary Focus: Groups

Groups are the main feature. Our priorities:
1. **Creating groups** — seamless, intuitive group creation
2. **Adding members** — frictionless invitations
3. **Building connections** — nurturing the network effect

## Design Principles

### Aether Design
- **Clean, consistent aesthetic** — no visual clutter
- **No banners, big headers, footers, or sidebars**
- **Forget the old internet** — break free from legacy patterns

### Navigation
- **Intuitive and adaptive**
- **As simple as possible, but not simpler**
- **Responsive patterns**: modals for desktop → drawers for mobile

### Content Philosophy
- **No helping texts** — we don't treat users like babies
- **Trust user intelligence** — guide through design, not words
- **Let the interface speak for itself**

| **Server-driven UI** | LiveView pushes state, client follows |

> 💡 If it can be live, it should be live.
